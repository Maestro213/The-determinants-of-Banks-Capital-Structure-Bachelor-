# The-determinants-of-Banks-Capital-Structure-Bachelor-
The following code I have used for data analysis in the course of the Bachelor seminar in Finance in 2020W for my bachelor's thesis paper. The main goal of my research paper was to analyze banks' capital structure. In order to prove or disprove my assumptions an empirical research was conducted. (panel data analysis)
The data set was obtained from Bankscope Bureau von Dijk. It consists of more than 400 Banks over the 2006-2019 period with total of over 5000 observations. 
For the econometrical analysis the data set was prepared (cleared and reshaped from wide to long) and tested (Hausman and Langrange Multipliere Test). 
Test has revealed that the data was panel with time and country-fixed effects.
